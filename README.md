# Anto
A new auxlang (auxiliary language) derived from Ido, Interlingue, Novial, Neo and Glosa

The first draft version of the **Anto** auxiliary language, its current working name, is published on 3 August 2024, in honor of the death date of **Louis Couturat**, exactly 100 years ago to the day, the primary creator of the **Ido** language. Anto can be used to mimic the grammatical categories and syntactic structures of specified natural languages.

Ido was the first of the **Esperanto** offshoots (also known as Esperant**ido**s, meaning an Esperanto offshoot - hence the name). The name Anto in its turn is derived, being Ido's child, from the word for _child_ in Ido, _inf**anto**_, and is also a reference to its grandparent Esper**anto**. Other auxiliary languages from a later date, namely **Occidental-Interlingue**, **Novial** (incl. **Intal**), **Neo** and **Interglossa/Glosa**, have had a strong influence on the creation of the Anto language.

## Phonotactics

Syllables can start with a vowel (including a diphthong), any single consonant, or any of the following consonant combinations: [similar to English].

Syllables can only end in vowel (including diphthongs), or any of the following single or double consonants: **m,n,l,r,s,t,q,w,y,p,f,k,sh,ng**.

## Stress

Multi-syllable words are nearly always stressed on the syllable before the final consonant in the word. The exceptions to this rule are:
- Plural nouns ending in -**as**, -**es** (pronounced _/əs/_) or -**ous**.
- Verbs ending in -**en** or -**et** (pronounced _/ən/_ and _/ət/_ resp.).
- Adjectives ending in -**in** or -**it**.
- Prepositions ending in -**er** (pronounced _/ər/_).
  
In those cases the penultimate syllable receives the stress. Words containing those sounds at the end of a word can still receive the stress on the final syllable, if they are written with doubled consonants at the end: **ss,nn,tt,rr**.
 
## Morphology and grammar

Single-syllable words can belong to any grammatical category. Multi-syllable words belong to a specific grammatical category, specified by the ending of the word.

Words ending in a consonant (except these word endings: **as**, **ous**, **er**, **es** and **et**), -**a** or -**ou** are singular nouns. The plural of a noun adds an -**s**.
Words ending in **e** are verbs. Verbs can carry the additional **n** or **t** endings.
Words ending in **i** are adjectives or adverbs, depending on their position in the word: adjectives precede or follow nouns, adverbs precede adjectives or follow verbs. Adjectives can also carry the additional **n** or **t** endings.
Words ending in **ei**, **ie**, **o** or **er** are prepositions and prefixes.

### Articles

The articles are **li** for the definite article and **en** for the indefinite article. The article **en** is pronounced _/ən/_. When this article needs to be stressed, it is written as **enn** and pronounced as _/en/_.
